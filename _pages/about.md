My name is Renee Aziz, and I am a current senior at Notre Dame majoring in Business Analytics and minoring in Theology. 

I am the recipient of a $100k merit scholarship at the University of Notre Dame and have had two international internships. My previous internship was at Deloitte, where I worked in Financial Risk and Advisory in the Bay Area.

I am interested in the intersection of data science, business, and economics. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeaziz/).
