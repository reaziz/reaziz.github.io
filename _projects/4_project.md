Our final project on Elite College Admissions consists of two main files: a detailed analytical report and the corresponding HTML file with code outputs. The report provides a comprehensive overview of our study, where we analyzed factors driving students' decisions to apply to specific colleges using predictive models like XGBoost, linear regression, and bagging. Our focus on variables such as SAT scores, income levels, and historical attendance allowed us to uncover significant insights into college application behavior across public and private institutions.

The HTML file showcases our code and visual outputs, allowing a transparent view of our methods and findings. Together, these files offer both a theoretical and practical look at our research, helping educators and universities better understand application trends and potential outreach improvements.
