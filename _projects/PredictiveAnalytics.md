This project, "Biking in the Rain: An Analysis of Temperature on the Bikeshare Business with ARIMA," explores the impact of temperature on registered user activity for Capital Bikeshare in Washington D.C., using data from 2011 to 2012. The primary objective is to understand how temperature and other weather variables influence the number of registered users, with the aim of identifying optimal periods for targeted marketing campaigns. By analyzing both casual and registered user behaviors, this study seeks insights into the potential for converting more casual users into registered subscribers during favorable weather conditions.

Through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and time-series forecasting with ARIMA, this project provides a comprehensive look at how seasonality and weather affect bikeshare usage. The ARIMA model is particularly valuable for predicting future trends based on historical data, capturing patterns such as seasonality and cyclicality. Ultimately, this analysis offers bikeshare companies insights into the best times to promote their services, suggesting that warmer months and certain weather conditions may be more conducive to increasing registered user activity.
