  title={Readability of Water Reports in the U.S.: Disclosing Information Biases Through Flesch Readability Ease Scores},
  author={Renee Aziz},
  abstract={The average reader has an 8th-grade reading ability, and all papers written for the public are at or below this level. Unfortunately, water quality reports, which reflect the water toxicity levels of counties across the U.S., can be unreadable by the public; sometimes, they reflect scores at the university level. Every individual in the U.S. has the right to know their water quality and the health risks of dangerous heavy metal levels. This paper analyzes more than 1,000 water reports in the U.S. using readability metrics. With Python, each PDF was parsed and text-extracted using optical character recognition. A dataframe displayed each water reportâ€™s readability through multiple readability indices. All processes disclosed a grave information bias that needs resolution.},
